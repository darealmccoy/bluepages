	<p>
		The Eagle Scout badge is the pinnacle, but not the peak of a Boy Scout's career.  It may be the highest, and most
		prestigious award he may recieve, however, the journey has only started.  The rank of Eagle shows the beginning of adulthood, 
		maturity, strength, leadership, and above all, an adherence to the 12 Scout Laws.  The badge does not mean anything to the 
		scout if they do not take time to represent the badge, and their brotherhood in good semlance to their community. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Upon earning the rank of Eagle, the scout will spread their wings and soar.  They will take on higher leadership positions, and tougher,
		more demanding projects. They will use their skills and knowledge to make te lives of their community, nation, and world a better, safer place.
		An Eagle Scout is always prepared for what might come ahead, and they are always ready to learn.

	</div>
	<p>
		These above badges resemble the ranks before Eagle.  Life, Star, First Class, Second Class, Tenderfoot, and Scout.
		They represent the journey and the progress a scout has made, and prove, not only to themselves, but the people
		around them, the time and dedication they have put in on the path to Eagle. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The Order of the Arrow is a fraternal organization of exceptional Scouts, while the organization has many of its secrets,
		all members must be voted in by the members of their troop.  The election process happens once every year, and scouts may 
		choose any number of scouts who have achieved the rank of First Class, been to a summer camp and a number of additonal 
		nights of camping in the last two years, into the Order of the Arrow. The Scouts are asked to vote not based on who their
		friends are, but based on who they believe carries out the Scout Oath, Law, and Motto, and who they know is a friend to all
		scouts.  All Scouts who earn 50% or more of their troops votes will then go through the tap out ceremony at their next 
		summercamp.
	</p>
	<p>
		During the Tap-Out Ceremony, members of the OA (Order of the Arrow) will perform a ceremony describing the origins and the 
		meaning of membership in the order of the Arrow.  Then, the tapping-out begins. OA Troopleaders will stand behind their scouts
		and hold up their OA sash (Pictured Above) to signal to the scouts in the ceremony that they have been selected by their troop.
		Then, they will be brought to the front stage, and called out to all of the scouts in attendance.
